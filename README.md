          When we tap a song, a media player shows up at the bottom of the screen and starts to play the preview for that song.

Requirements to build the app - If you are on latest flutter version, you might consider downgrading to Flutter version- v1.0.0+1+hotfix.4, for the application to work. This application supports Flutter version: 1.0.0+1+hotfix.4 because of the dependency on the library - "assets_audio_player - 2.0.13" which is dependent on the Flutter version - v1.0.0+1+hotfix.4. This library is used to display media player on the screen. Android Studio version - 4.1.1 & Gradle version - 4.10.2 was used for the development of the project. Hence, please use mentioned versions respectively, if you face any issues while compiling the project.
